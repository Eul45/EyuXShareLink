# EyuX Chat Share Link Viewer

This repository hosts the static front-end viewer for shared conversations generated by the **EyuX AI Assistant** Android app. It is a simple, self-contained HTML page designed to fetch and render chat logs in a clean, readable format.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to provide a shareable, web-accessible link for conversations created within the EyuX app. This allows users to easily share their interactions with the AI on any platform, viewable on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## How It Works

1.  **Link Generation:** The EyuX Android app uploads a JSON object containing the conversation data to a secure, serverless backend (`eyux-share-api`).
2.  **ID Retrieval:** The backend returns a unique ID for the stored conversation.
3.  **URL Construction:** The app constructs a URL pointing to the `index.html` file in this repository, appending the unique ID as a query parameter (e.g., `.../index.html?id=UNIQUE_ID`).
4.  **Fetching & Rendering:** When a user opens the link, the JavaScript within `index.html` extracts the ID from the URL, fetches the corresponding JSON data from the API, and dynamically builds the chat view in the browser.

### Features

-   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for viewing on both mobile and desktop screens.
-   **Markdown & Code Rendering:** Correctly formats text and code blocks sent by the AI.
-   **Mermaid Diagram Support:** Renders Mermaid.js diagrams directly in the browser.
-   **Dark/Light Theme:** Includes a theme switcher that saves the user's preference.
-   **Promotional Banner:** Includes a subtle banner to promote the EyuX Android app with a download link.
